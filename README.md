# Pupil "Research" Plugin Suite
Plugin suite for running custom Python scripts interacting with [Pupil](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil).

- `psychopy_pupil_utils` is a set of PsychoPy classes which are used to visualize calibration and surface markers. The calibration markers are drawn using multiple Circle objects on top of each other. The surface markers use pre-rendered images generated by [`make_square_markers.py`](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pupil-helpers/blob/master/make_square_markers.py).

- `pupil_interface` is a Python module which uses `Pupil Sync` to remote control `Pupil` software.

- `script_loader [DEPRECATED]` is a `Pupil` plugin which starts custom Python script in a separate process and provides a simple interface for the script to remote control the `Pupil` software. Inter-process communication is done using pipes. This plugin is deprecated. `pupil_interface` provides the same functionality with the advantage to have network communication.
